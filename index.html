    <h2>Croissant</h2>
    <div class="container">
      <p>
        These flaky, golden-colored, crescent-shaped pastries are best made with
        pure butter and a slightly sweet yeast dough. If made properly, the
        yellow-white interior should be just the slightest bit elastic when
        pulled from the center, ready to be covered with a pad of butter or some
        fresh jam. Experts agree that the croissant was heavily influenced by
        Austrian kipfels. This pastry originated in 1683 as a celebration of the
        Austrian victory over the Ottoman Empire, its shape supposedly mimicking
        the crescent moon found on the Turkish flag. However, the croissant
        became French the moment people began to make it with puff pastry, a
        French innovation. Today, French croissants come filled with chocolate,
        jam, raisins, or even cream cheese. Sold fresh at numerous French
        boulangeries, they are mainly consumed as a breakfast item.

    <h2>It All Starts In Vienna & Eastern Europe</h2>

        You may have already read the shocking news elsewhere: croissants
        weren’t invented in France. (Ok, you’re probably just curious about the
        factoid, but never mind). As with every aspect of tracing the
        croissant’s tortuous history, however, it’s actually a bit more
        complicated than that. Most food historians trace the origins of the
        croissant to Austria and elsewhere in Eastern Europe, where small
        pastries called kipferl had been made since at least the 13th century,
        according to numerous records.

        While little is known about their original composition, kipferl were
        simple pastries that might be served plain or laced with nuts. They bore
        a resemblance to rugelach, consumed widely in Eastern Europe and a
        staple of Yiddish cuisine. Rugelach, however, were probably invented in
        the 17th century.
